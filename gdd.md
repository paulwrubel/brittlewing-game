# Brittlewing Game Design Document

## Preamble

### Concept

## Genre and Influences

- Animal Crossing flower breeding and genetics mechanic
- casual games
- puzzle games

## Mechanics

Flowers can be planted, watered, and picked. Flowers each have a genome which
consists of some number of genes. Two flowers can breed together to create a
child, whose genome is determined from the genomes of its parents via a punnett
square.

There are differing classes of flowers, separated be the number of genes in
their genome:

- Common (2 Genes)
- Uncommon (3 Genes)
- Rare (4 Genes)
- Exotic (5 Genes)

Additionally, flowers of differing species can breed together to create new,
derivative species (e.g. Tulip + Lily = Tulily) This will allow the player to
create new flower species via cross-breeding, including new species unique to
this game (such as the eponymous "Brittlewing")
